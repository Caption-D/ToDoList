# ToDoList
This is the to-do-list which is also rendered on heroku and is on the internet, this is also having a database  of mongodb and the mongo Atals is the cloud service we use storing the data , this website is a basic to do list and on 17/08/22 there is no UI/UX to it and we need to change the page by changing the URL in the chrome tab. There is a lot that can be added to the site and hopefully we will add the following features soon. 1) UI/UX to go to / create new list 2) Edit the already added items 3) change the colour schema of the app 4) add login for multiple users , Just that for now.
